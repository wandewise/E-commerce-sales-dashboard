ðŸ“ˆ RECOMMENDATIONS Based on the Insights:

â¸»
1.Optimize Sales Promotions Around Indian Festivals

Insight: Sales peaked around Diwali (Nov 7, 2018) and Gandhi Jayanti (Oct 2).
Recommendation:

Plan targeted marketing campaigns 1â€“2 days before major festivals. Offer discounts or bundles starting at least 48 hours before the festival â€” customers seem to shop just before the event.

2.Focus Promotions Around Peak Weekdays: Sunday, Monday, and Thursday

Insight: Your top-performing days are Sunday (weekend), Monday (start of workweek), and Thursday (pre-weekend mindset).

Recommendation:

Run your biggest promotions, flash sales, or marketing pushes on Sunday, Monday, and Thursday.
These days show strong customer intent â€” take advantage of:

â€¢Sunday shopping habits (leisure, restocking)
â€¢Thursday momentum for weekend prep
â€¢Monday fresh-start energy (impulse or routine purchases)

3.Use Micro-Targeting for These Peak Days

Set email or SMS reminders for Thursday evenings and Sunday mornings.
Use Google/Facebook Ads scheduling to increase ad visibility from Thursday to Monday, especially on Sunday morning and MondayÂ lunchÂ hours.

5.Capitalize on Recovery Months (Augâ€“Nov, Janâ€“Mar)

6.Treat February as a Risk Month

Insight: Sales dropped in February 2019, despite Jan and Mar performing well.
Recommendation:

Investigate if this is due to fewer days, budget cycles, or low engagement post-festivals.
Test running mid-month sales or Valentine-themed offers to stimulateÂ demand.
